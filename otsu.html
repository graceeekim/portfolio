							Pathwise Credit Union—previously Auto Workers Community Credit Union Financial (AWCCU Financial)—first opened its doors on April 2, 1938, primarily serving the financial needs of auto workers and their families in Oshawa and the surrounding Durham region. As the local community changed and grew, AWCCU Financial needed to update their name and branding to show that they were a great local option for anyone in the Durham region, and that they did not serve members of the automotive industry exclusively.
							<br>
							<br>
							I began to work with Pathwise towards the end of the rebranding process, after the logo, colours, and fonts were chosen. I helped to establish the brand guidelines and conceptualized the designs of marketing assets across various mediums.
							<br>
							<br>
							With a mission of "helping people find their path to financial success", their branding focuses on using photography that resonates with the diverse demographics of their members. The parts of the logo are used as a striking and memorable graphic element.
